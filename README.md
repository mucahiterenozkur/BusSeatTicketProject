# BusSeatTicketProject

This project aims to simulate a bus travelling app which consists of;<br><br>
✔️ Onboarding screen, <br>
✔️ A great search page for departure and destination point with mapKit (MKLocalSearch) and date picker, <br>
✔️ Available tickets page which has custom table view cells, <br>
✔️ Choosing seats page which was built with custom collection view cell, <br>
✔️ SCLAlertView pod, <br>
✔️ A page for completing the buy phase, (you enter some informations like id, HES code etc.) <br>
✔️ Displaying the bought ticket page, <br><br>
👉 This was the first project that I made in Turkcell Geleceği Yazanlar Bootcamp.<br> <br>
